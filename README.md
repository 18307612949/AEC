# AEC
This code implents Acoustic Echo Cancellation with LMS/RLS in MATLAB.  
I make a GUI program based on MATLAB GUI.I tried the new App designer framework of MATLAB R2017b. Sadly, there isn't an 
alternative function of `spectrogram()` ,so I use the old GUI framework back.
## Contents
* `AEC_V2.5` includes the GUI program which consists of `Echo_cancel.fig` and `Echo_cancel.m`. For quick test, 
you can just use the folder to see the result.
* `Filter_param` is used to find the best params for different types of filters. If you want to learn more about the detail, 
you can dig up.
* If you know Chinese, just see `MATLAB代码说明.pdf`. :)
